<div style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;">
In this article, we examine the limitations of the generic churn model as the forecast problem in machine learning, then propose a more practical churn model and marketing intervention system based on that. This system not only predicts the churn of customers, but, most importantly, it can provide a solution on how to intervene with the customer and retain them. After all, retaining customers and creating market value at a reasonable cost is one of the most important purposes of building a churn model. In the second part, we analyze all the challenges in building a customer churn model and how to find the optimal intervention action.
